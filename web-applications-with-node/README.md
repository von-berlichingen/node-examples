# Building Node web applications
Covered in this part:
* Handling HTTP requests with Node's API
* Building a RESTful web service
* Serving static files
* Accepting user input from forms
* Securing applications with HTTPS

Like most modules in Node's core, the http module favors simplicity. High-lever "sugar" APIs are left for third-party frameworks, such as Connect or Express, that greatly simplify the web application building process.
