# Building a RESTful web service
To create a compliant REST server, you need to implement the four HTTP verbs. Each verb will cover a different task for the to-do-list:
* **POST**: add itemts to the to-do list
* **GET**: display a listing of the current items, or display the details of a specific items
* **DELETE**: remove items from the to-do list
* **PUT**: modify existing items
